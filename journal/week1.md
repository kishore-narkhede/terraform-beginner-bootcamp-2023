# Terraform Beginner Bootcamp 2023 - Week 1

## Root Module Structure

Our root module structure is as follows:

```
PROJECT_ROOT
│
├── main.tf                 # everything else.
├── variables.tf            # stores the structure of input variables
├── terraform.tfvars        # the data of variables we want to load into our terraform project
├── providers.tf            # defined required providers and their configuration
├── outputs.tf              # stores our outputs
└── README.md               # required for root modules
```

## Terraform and Input Variables

### Terraform Cloud Variables

In terraform we can set two kind of variables:

- Enviroment Variables - those you would set in your bash terminal eg. AWS credentials
- Terraform Variables - those that you would normally set in your tfvars file

We can set Terraform Cloud variables to be sensitive so they are not shown visibliy in the UI.

### Loading Terraform Input Variables

[Terraform Input Variables](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables)

### var flag

We can use the `-var` flag to set an input variable or override a variable in the tfvars file eg. `terraform -var user_id="my-user_id"`

### var-file flag

To set lots of variables, it is more convenient to specify their values in a variable definitions file (with a filename ending in either .tfvars or .tfvars.json) and then specify that file on the command line with -var-file:

`terraform apply -var-file="testing.tfvars"`

### terraform.tvfars

This is the default file to load in terraform variables in blunk

### auto.tfvars

Terraform automatically loads a number of variable definitions files if they are present:

- Files named exactly terraform.tfvars or terraform.tfvars.json.
- Any files with names ending in .auto.tfvars or .auto.tfvars.json.

### order of terraform variables

Terraform loads variables in the following order, with later sources taking precedence over earlier ones:

Environment variables

- The terraform.tfvars file, if present.
- The terraform.tfvars.json file, if present.
- Any _.auto.tfvars or _.auto.tfvars.json files, processed in lexical order of their filenames.
- Any -var and -var-file options on the command line, in the order they are provided. (This includes variables set by a Terraform Cloud workspace.)
